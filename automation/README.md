## Quick Start

### Automated Upload Workflow (Recommended)

The new `upload` command provides enhanced automation with intelligent memory management and progress monitoring:

```bash
# Basic automated upload workflow
node batch-processor.js upload /path/to/audio/files

# With custom batch size and debugging
node batch-processor.js upload /path/to/audio/files --batch-size 50 --visible --screenshots

# Resume from previous session
node batch-processor.js upload /path/to/audio/files --resume

# Clear previous state and start fresh
node batch-processor.js upload /path/to/audio/files --clear-state
```

### Legacy Batch Processing

```bash
# Basic processing (legacy mode)
node batch-processor.js process /path/to/audio/files

# With custom batch size
node batch-processor.js process /path/to/audio/files --batch-size 50
```

### File Discovery and Analysis

```bash
# Analyze a directory without processing
node batch-processor.js discover /path/to/audio/files
```

### Server Management

```bash
# Start the MIR web server for manual use
node batch-processor.js server

# Start server on specific port
node batch-processor.js server --port 3001
```

### Progress Monitoring

```bash
# Check current processing status and CSV merge availability
node batch-processor.js status

# Clear processing state
node batch-processor.js clear
```

### CSV Merge Operations

```bash
# Merge batch CSV files into a unified result (NEW)
node batch-processor.js merge

# Check available batch files for merging
node batch-processor.js merge-status

# Advanced merge with custom options
node batch-processor.js merge --input-dir ./custom/batch_csvs --output-dir ./results --cleanup
```

node batch-processor.js upload ~/Music
```

**What this does:**
- Discovers all audio files in ~/Music
- Creates optimized batches (100 files each)
- Starts web server automatically
- Launches browser automation
- Uploads files batch by batch
- Monitors analysis progress with real-time updates
- Downloads CSV for each batch automatically
- Manages browser memory between batches
- Provides comprehensive final report

### Example 2: Large Collection Processing
```bash
# Process large collection with smaller batches for memory optimization
node batch-processor.js upload /media/music-collection --batch-size 50
```

### Example 3: Development and Debugging
```bash
# Run with visible browser and screenshots for troubleshooting
node batch-processor.js upload ~/test-music --visible --screenshots --batch-size 10
```

### Example 4: Resume Interrupted Processing
```bash
# Resume from where processing was interrupted
node batch-processor.js upload ~/Music --resume
```

### Example 5: Production Processing
```bash
# Production run with clean state
node batch-processor.js upload ~/Music --clear-state --headless
```

### Example 6: Discovery and Planning
```bash
# Analyze collection before processing
node batch-processor.js discover ~/Music

# Check progress during processing (in another terminal)
node batch-processor.js status
```

### Example 7: CSV Merge Operations (NEW)
```bash
# Merge batch CSV files into a unified result
node batch-processor.js merge

# Check available batch files for merging
node batch-processor.js merge-status

# Advanced merge with custom options
node batch-processor.js merge --input-dir ./custom/batch_csvs --output-dir ./results --cleanup
```

### Example 8: Complete Automated Workflow (NEW)
```bash
# Complete automated workflow with auto-merge
node batch-processor.js upload ~/Music

# Automatic workflow:
# 1. Process 400-500+ songs in batches of 100
# 2. Download batch CSVs: batch_001_*.csv, batch_002_*.csv, etc.
# 3. Automatically merge all batches into: music_analysis_complete_2024-12-23.csv
# 4. Present final unified CSV with all results
```

### Example 9: Upload Without Auto-merge
```bash
# Upload with manual merge control
node batch-processor.js upload ~/Music --no-merge

# Then manually merge when ready
node batch-processor.js merge
```
